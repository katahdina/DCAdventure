                            <p> For some backstory, my grandmother passed away on January 17th, 2025. Her funeral was then scheduled for a time that all of my dads side family could attend which happened to be March 29th, 2025. Since I usually wait until the last minute to do things,
                                including making this map, The cheapest flight to attend her funeral gave me an 7.5 hour layover overnight in the Ronald Reagan National Airport (DCA) from approximately 1am to 8:30am. </p>
                            <p>Instead of trying and most likely failing to get sleep in the airport, I conconcted a plan to go sight see some of the famous land marks around the DC area. All of my travel would be on foot, and based on my gps tracking that I did with Strava,
                                I walked a total of 12.08 miles between the hours of 1-5:30am, and yes I made it back to the airport in time to make my fligt to my grandma's funeral. I take pride in my ability to take on challenges and push myslef mentally and physically. I really enjoyed this little adventure I had, and loved the resulting video I made from it. I hope to continue to do things like this in the future. </p>

Technically I didn't go up to the <a href="#" onclick="seekTo(360)">US Capitol </a> building itself because that would have added more mileage than I was comfortbale doing. Instead I opted to view it from across the reflecting pond in front of it. On my way to the Capitol I was able to see the outside of the Air and Space Museum which I have vague memories of going in as a kid.</p>

                        <p>This was stop number three on my route. Just like the Capitol I didn't really get too close to it, although this time it was because of all the security around it. If you watch the YouTube video, I mistakenly call it the 
                        <a href="#" onclick="seekTo(472)">"Light House" </a> because of how tired I am.</p>

                            <p> This was the second to last stop on my journey and I was definitely feeling how long my walk had been. It was fun to actually go up and <a href="#" onclick="seekTo(527)">touch </a> the monument after having seen it in the distance for so long.

The novelty of the craziness of what I was doing had run it's course and I was just running on <a href="#" onclick="seekTo(639)">fumes</a>.

My goal was to try and see all of the locations I wanted to see while covering the shortest distance that I could. I also didn't have a preset route in mind, other than the order of locations and this meant that I ended up jumping a few fences and crossing a highway using a railroad bridge.
